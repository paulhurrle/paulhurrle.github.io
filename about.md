I am a married father of five with two dogs living in the desert known as Phoenix, AZ. I have worked in higher education since 2006 as an academic counselor and since 2009 as a Manager of Student Services.

After earning multiple degrees in Psychology (B.A.; MS/P) and Business (MBA) in my late 20s, I decided to scratch an itch I had for years. In 2015, I enrolled in a computer science degree program where I learned about many things including web design and information security. After graduating in 2016, I wasn't finished learning, yet I had discovered a real passion for programming. So I enrolled in Bloc's Web Development program in order to strengthen my skills and prepare for my new career.

My goal is to transition from front-end developer-in-training to full-time developer in early 2018. I cannot wait to show the world what I can do!
