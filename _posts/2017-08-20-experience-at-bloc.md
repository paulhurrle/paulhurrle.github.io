title: Experience at Bloc

So you're ready to start learning how to become a web developer, huh? The good news is you have many options. The bad news is...you have <em>many</em> options. Just open up your laptop and search for web development training. You could try learning on your own using free courseware. You could enroll in a 2-year or 4-year program at a University. You could find a boot camp that you could complete in as little as 8 weeks.

I'm not going to try to convince you what you should do, as you should weigh carefully all the factors that matter to you - time, cost, quality, and outcomes just to name a few. What I can tell you is that I have been completely satisfied by my experience after 9 weeks of Bloc's 27-week Web Development program. The curriculum is demanding but doable if you put in the requisite 20+ hours per week. The support is great - a big thank you to my front-end development mentor, Junior, who has already rescued me from one or two near disasters over the past few months. The tuition is comparable with other boot camp programs, but in return for the investment of my time and money I get a guarantee of job placement, which not all competitors offer. It says something when a company stands so confidently behind their product.

I'm someone who second guesses 99.9% of the decisions I make, but not this one. This was the right decision for me!
