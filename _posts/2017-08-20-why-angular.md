title: What did I do to offend you, Angular?
---
You've just completed your second web development project. You had a few minor bumps and bruises, but you more than survived. You conquered every challenge JavaScript threw at you, and jQuery's library was no match for you. Bring on the next challenge, you say. I am ready for anything, you say. And then,

<em>WHAM!!</em>

Angular unleashes its furious and merciless wrath upon you. Your self-esteem and confidence shattered, you try to regroup and prepare yourself for a rematch. Another savage beating. Then another. You begin to ask yourself,

<em>What did I do to offend you, Angular?</em>

You are in too deep to turn back. You summon every ounce of courage you have to face the beast again. This continues, day after day, until somewhere along the line, you start to realize something. The beast's battle strategy looks the same every time.

You study its modules, factories, and directives closely and learn to anticipate its movements with increased precision. You learn the secret to controlling the beast lies in its...<em>controller</em>...and you are relentless in your efforts to understand it. You don't know where the fortitude is coming from or how long it will last, but you refuse to give in, knowing victory will be yours one day.

This is a true account of the experience had by yours truly on or about July, 2017.
